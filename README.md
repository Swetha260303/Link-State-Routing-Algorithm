# Link-State-Routing-Algorithm
A link-state routing system is able to build a topological picture of large networks. It gathers data from all connected routers that provide an identical picture of the network topology. The network's constructed topology-map determines the ideal route for efficient traffic communication across the hops. Measurement of the two link state routing protocols Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Intermediate System to Intermediate System is the primary objective of this study (IS-IS). In order to assess the effectiveness of OSPF and IS-IS under various conditions, we build a corporate network. Designing enterprise network models and choosing the best routing protocol for various traffic scenarios will be made easier with the help of the in-depth examination of the aforementioned routing protocol.Dijkstra's method is applied to the graph by each node to determine the best paths between all other nodes. The Dijkstra's algorithm, also referred to as the link state routing algorithm, determines the shortest route between each node in the network.
